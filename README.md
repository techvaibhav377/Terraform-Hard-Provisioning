# **Terraform-Hard-Provisioning**

## **Terraform Project: Deploying a Web Server with DNS Configuration**

ðŸš€ Automate the deployment of a web server and configure DNS using AWS resources with Terraform. This project is designed for scalability and modularity, with separate files for each component.

## **Project Structure**

- **provider.tf:** Configures the AWS provider with the desired region and credentials.
- **variable.tf:** Defines input variables used throughout the project.
- **resource.tf:** Defines the AWS resources to be provisioned, including instances, security groups, and key pairs.
- **script.sh:** Bash script for configuring the web server and DNS.

## **Deployment Steps**

1. **Instance Provisioning:** Terraform provisions an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. **DNS Configuration:** The script named.conf and vaibhav_dns zone file are deployed to the instance using Terraform's file provisioner.
3. **Web Server Setup:** The script.sh script is executed on the instance to install and configure Apache HTTP Server (httpd), download a web content zip file, and set up the web server document root.
4. **DNS Service Start:** The DNS service (named) is started on the instance.

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up AWS credentials and region in the provider.tf file.
3. Customize input variables in the variable.tf file if necessary.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
5. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes.
6. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision the resources.
7. Access the website via the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

## **Requirements**

- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Terraform concepts.
